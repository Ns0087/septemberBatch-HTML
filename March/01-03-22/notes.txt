callback function:
They are going to call the function after some amount of time.
array inbuild methods:
//map,filter,reduce 
//above method will work only with array.
map:
//The main aim is to change the array of objects.
//map function will not change the original array.
//map function will help to change both key and value.
//map function will create new array.
filter:
//The main aim is to filter the data from set of data.
//filter function will create new array.
Real time Use case:
//in real time mostly we will use filter + map function together.
reduce:
//The main aim is to add the set of data together 
//reduce function will give new result.
===============================================
spread operator:
//it will spread the array into individual values.
//it will return new array.
Rest operator:
//it will combine individual values to array 
//it will create new array.
===========================================
exception handling:
try 
catch 
finally 
//entire exception handling we should write inside the function.
//if everything is fine only "try" block will run 
//if some error happen in "try" block then "catch" will run 
//In any scenarion whether is is going to "try" or "catch" "finally" will run always for all scenario.
===========
try:
//the entire right code is written here.
catch:
//error is capture here.
finally
//it will run always.
