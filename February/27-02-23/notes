//let and const 
//it is block scope variable 
//it is advance syntax
//instead of using var we can use let keyword 
//let we cannot redeclare again
//const is block scope variable 
//const we cannot redeclare as well as we cannot reassign the value.
//var we have so many drawbacks. please don't use that variable.
======================================================
Function Declaration:
A function declaration also known as a function statement declares a function with a function keyword. The function declaration must have a function name.
Function declaration does not require a variable assignment as they are standalone constructs and they cannot be nested inside a functional block.
These are executed before any other code.
The function in function declaration can be accessed before and after the function definition.
Syntax:
<script>
 function addition(a,b){
        return a+b;
    }

</script>

A function Expression is similar to a function declaration without the function name.
Function expressions can be stored in a variable assignment.
Function expressions load and execute only when the program interpreter reaches the line of code.
The function in function expression can be accessed only after the function definition.
Syntax:

<script>
 const subtraction = (a,b)=>{
        return a-b;
    }
</script>
